    about: `I build things that excite me — usually by chasing ideas that spark curiosity or help me learn something new.

Most of the time, I recreate things that already exist — not to copy, but to understand how and why they work. It’s my way of learning deeply and sharpening how I think.

I don’t just code — I explore. I talk to builders, dive into their perspectives, and try to see problems from all angles. Whether I’m building solo or with a team, I care about why we’re doing something just as much as how.

I say: “Curiosity can make you great.”
And I try to prove that with every project I take on.`,
